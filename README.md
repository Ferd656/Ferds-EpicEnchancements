## ┈┈┈┈ Dragons rebalanced ┈┈┈┈

Dragons do more damage, their attacks apply [status effecs](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Status_effects) on enemies dependindG on damage type.

All adult dragon attacks do a decent amount of pickaxe and chop damage so they are all good resource gathering engines.

Given crafting costs tweaks over dragon eggs, Mountain Dragon is balanced according to its fire and lightning counterparts in terms of damage, health and resistances.

Health and resistances set to:

# 🐛 Known bugs

There is a known bug reported from 'vanilla' DragonRiders, caused by an asset desynchronization within ZNetView, which causes FPS harshly drops due to process queue overflow. FerdsEpicEnhancements applies patches to related ZNetView methods in order to avoid this issue, neverthless if this happens to you anyway, just save the world and restart the game, that should temporarily solve the issue.
