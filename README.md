## 🐛 Known bugs

There is a known bug reported from 'vanilla' DragonRiders, caused by an asset desynchronization within ZNetView, which causes FPS harshly drops due to process queue overflow. FerdsEpicEnhancements applies patches to related ZNetView methods in order to avoid this issue, neverthless if this happens to you anyway, just save the world and restart the game, that should temporarily solve the issue.
